Analyzing Movie Reviews

This project is an attempt to analyze how different movie services rate the movies.
Each row represents a single movie. Each column contains information about how the online moview review services like RottenTomatoes, Metacritic, IMDB, and Fandango rated the movie. The dataset was put together to help detect bias in the movie review sites. Each of these sites has 2 types of score -- User scores, which aggregate user reviews, and Critic score, which aggregate professional critical reviews of the movie. Each service puts their ratings on a different scale:
  RottenTomatoes -- 0-100, in increments of 1.
  Metacritic -- 0-100, in increments of 1.
  IMDB -- 0-10, in increments of .1.
  Fandango -- 0-5, in increments of .5
